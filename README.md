# Morgan Bailey Website

## Description

This website is a personal portfolio for Morgan Bailey. This task was to create a responsive website using Bootstrap with a consisten navigation bar, three pages (About Me, Portfolio, and Contact), and responsive images. 

Media queries were limited by using Bootstrap elements throughout the website. The grid system was also implemented, and sizing is dependent on screen size.
